In this code we have minted our own tokens , we have created the inital public variables which stores the information about our coin such as its name ,its symbol ,its initalsupply which is set to zero
then we have a mint function to create coins with certain addresses as their owners and in contrast to mint function we have our burn function which destroy the total supply of the coins
